tikz-cd â€” Commutative diagrams with TikZ
========================================

The general-purpose drawing package [TikZ][pgf] can be used to typeset
commutative diagrams and other kinds of mathematical pictures,
generating high-quality results.  This TikZ library facilitates the
creation of such diagrams by providing a convenient set of macros and
reasonable default settings.  It can be used in plain TeX, LaTeX and
ConTeXt.  See [the manual][tikz-cd-doc] for further details and many
examples.
