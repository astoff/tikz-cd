tikz-cd -- Commutative diagrams with tikz
=========================================

The general-purpose drawing package tikz can be used to typeset
commutative diagrams and other kinds of mathematical pictures,
generating high-quality results.  The present package facilitates the
creation of such diagrams by providing a convenient set of macros and
reasonable default settings.  It also includes an arrow tip library
closely matching the Computer Modern arrow tips, as well as a general
mechanism to use the arrow tips from any math font in TikZ graphics.
